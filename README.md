# The problem

Let $X_n$ be the sequence of $n$ natural numbers $a_0, a_1,\ldots, a_{n-1}$ for which three properties are true:
1. $a_i=a_{i-1} + i$ for $0 < i < n$
2. None of the sequence terms is prime.
3. There is no other sequence with the above properties and a smaller initial term $a_0$.

The first such sequences are:

$X_1 = [1]$

$X_2 = [8,9]$

$X_3 = [9, 10, 12]$

$X_4 = [9, 10, 12, 15]$

$X_5 = [15, 16, 18, 21, 25]$

Your Goal: Please find the initial term $a_0$ of the sequence $X_{1000}$

A Bonus "*" will be given for finding the initial term $a_0$ of the sequence $X_{2024}$
